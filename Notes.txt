python
1. symbolic computing
fixed rotation in modeling, 
multiply the J1,J2,J3 with the respective time interval as costs,
no need to add 1*time_interval
fixed the bounds for yaw
change the lower bound for time interval to 0.1, else infeasible with 0
similar as function handle in matlab, there is a lambda in python, defining what can be passed as constant into a function which calls another function

2. py in ros
make executable chmod +x scripts/add_two_ints_server.py
add to launch: /home/walt/catkin_ws/src/rotors_simulator/rotors_gazebo/launch/mav_with_waypoint_py.launch
#!/usr/bin/env python as first line
global declare
rospy.init_node
rospy.loginfo == ROS_INFO
sub: topic, type, callback
pub: topic, type, queue
rospy.Duration.from_sec(1)
